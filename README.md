## Getting Started

1) Install the application on the device.

2) Change the default system keyboard from `settings > system > languages & input > virtual keyboard > manage keyboards > enable & disable other keyboards`

3) Try using any edit text or search fields and kBoard's keyboard would pop up and enjoy experimenting with it...
