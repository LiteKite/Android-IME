This mess is all to draw a rectangle in the right place on the screen.
Here's what's going on:
    - Keyboard uses the intrinsic size of the drawable to work out where the drawable should be
      centered in the key.
    - Inset uses the intrinsic size of its inner drawable. This effectively scales the drawable
      down to add padding, and doesn't make the drawable bigger.
    - LayerList uses the maximum intrinsic size of its items as its intrinsic size.
    - So, we use a LayerList with a blank shape that assumes the size of the keyboard key.
    - We then add an inset with insetTop + insetBottom + inner shape = size of key.
